# Preston Haynes

Hi! My name is Preston Haynes. I am graduating from Westminster College Winter 2020. This portfolio is a collection of assignments, my senior project, and resume.

# Assignments 

## [Board Counter](https://github.com/prestonhaynes/BoardCounter)

For this assignment, I was able to choose what I wanted to make as an iOS app. I decided to create something that I would find personally useful. I learned about mobile design and using constraints so an app could work on many different screen sizes.

## [ChatRoom](https://github.com/prestonhaynes/ChatRoom)

This assignment was a group project on creating a chat client and server that followed a protocol that the entire class created so that all groups clients and apps would be able to work with each other. This required the class think through the design of the protocol to find and remove any ambiguity as that could cause incompatibility between groups applications.

Working in a group, I took on the initial development of the server and my partner took on the initial development of the client. After we got the barebones of the client and server, we worked with each other on both to overcome issues and challenges that we found.

## [One Time Pad VB](https://github.com/prestonhaynes/One-Time-Pad-VB)

This was assigned to be an easy assignment; implement a one time pad program in any programming language of your choice. I decided to take the "any programming language" as an opportunity to challenge myself. 

I decided to learn an older language that no one really learns anymore and implemented the assignment with it. I choose Visual Basic as Microsoft still maintains a compiler for it in it's .NET suite. It was a mix of familiar and unfamiliar territory. Concepts such as loops and switches were present, but implementation of them was foreign to me.

## [Pi Project](https://github.com/prestonhaynes/Pi-Project)

This project gave me lower level experience with hardware as I was needing to read from a sensor connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO to get temp and humidity readings. 

## [SLCC Advance Javascript Project](https://github.com/prestonhaynes/SLCC-Advance-Javascript-Project)

This was a group project I worked on my last semester at Salt Lake Community College before transferring to Westminster. This was a large group project that took the entire second half of the semester of the class. This project also gave experience in a group where a person did not pull their agreed upon weight, causing other members to pick up the slack in a last minute crunch.

The first part of this project was to find a client to create a website for and to work with them to create the specification they need for the site.

In the group, we split up parts of the website to different members and had one member dedicated to putting all the pages together for a cohesive website. 

Towards the end of the semester, the person who was responsible for putting all the pages together stopped showing up to class and was not responding to anyones messages. As we were finishing up the pages, me and the rest of the group need to work together to get the webpages put together.
